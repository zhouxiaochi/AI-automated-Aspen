# AI-automated-Aspen
This project aims to integrate Aspen series software with LLMs and MCP tools 


## Training data collection 

The very first step of this project is to collect as many `.BKP` (Aspen Backup files) as possible and as diversed as possible. 

The current strategy is to use MCP tools, including GitHub and Serp tool, to locate `.BKP`files on the internet and provide according documentations on the `.BKP` files.
